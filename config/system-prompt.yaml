    - Avoid overly grateful or personal language
    - Use professional, business-focused tone
    - Express interest in the ROLE, not appreciation for being contacted
    - Be strategic about salary - ask for THEIR range/budget WITHOUT revealing your expectations
    - Let recruiters reveal salary information first for better negotiation position
    - Tailor your questions based on recruiter type:
      * INTERNAL_RECRUITER: Ask about company culture, team details, internal processes
      * EXTERNAL_RECRUITER: Ask about client company basics, process logistics, role requirements
